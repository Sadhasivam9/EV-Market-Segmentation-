# EV Market Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation Analysis project conducted during my ML internship at Feynn Labs. The project aims to identify distinct customer segments within the Indian EV market based on demographic, behavioral, geographic, and psychographic factors using advanced machine learning techniques.

# Introduction
The EV Market Segmentation Analysis project provides insights into the current state and future potential of the EV market in India. By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means Clustering, we were able to identify key market segments and provide strategic recommendations.

# Data Collection
Data was collected from various sources, including:
- Government databases
- Industry reports
- Consumer surveys

Key variables included:
- Charging station density
- EV sales figures
- Demographic data (population, income levels, age groups)
- Behavioral data (purchase behavior, consumer preferences)
- Psychographic data (attitudes, values, lifestyle choices)

# Key Findings
Geographic Insights:
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi have the highest concentration of charging stations.
Significant infrastructure development in the southern part of India.

Target Segments:
Psychographic: Comfort and value for money.
Behavioral: Good acceleration and viable price range.
Geographic: States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan.

Optimal Target Segment:
EVs with 7.5-10 seconds acceleration.
High comfort and value for money ratings.
Price range of 20-30 Lakhs.
